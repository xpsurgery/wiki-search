a kata for practicing a refactoring:  template method -> strategy pattern

This exercise was inspired by one invented by Mike Hill and Ivan Moore. Their version of it is available [on Mike Hill's github](https://github.com/hillmlogica/fitnesse)

Instructions
------------

The code starts out by using Template Method - look at ResultResponder and its subclasses. The exercise is to refactor this code to instead use the Strategy Pattern - in other words replace inheritance with composition.
